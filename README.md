## PID Implementation

Per the suggestion within the code, two PID controllers are used to control both the *Steering* and augmented by *Throttle Speed*.

### Steering

To start finding the optimal parameters for __Steering__, through a continual process of trial and error and visually inspecting the results on the Simuulator, I applied the following methodology:

- Initially set the `P` (*Proportional Control*), `I` (*Integral Control*) and `D` (*Derivative Control*) __PID__ components to `0`. 
- Increasing the proportional gain which increases the degree of vehicle oscillation.
- To offset this, increase the derivative gain and in turn decreasing the proportional gain to reduce the overall vehicle oscillation. It was noted that a too high an increase in the derivative gain causes the vehicle to over-steer. To reduce this this, without compromising the proportional gain, I gradually introduced integral gain to compensate for this and keep the vehicle toward the center.

>__Note:__ This tuning methodology does not apply high speeds above `52`, therefore the values are lowered and constrained by the *Throttle Speed*.

### Throttle Speed

The __Throttle Speed__ is indirectly proportional to the `cte` (*cross track error*), which is the error from the desired position on the track. Basically, if the `cte` is high, then there is drift from the desired position. It was observed that a high `cte` occurred when the vehicle accelerated beyond `52` and thus the *Throttle Speed* PID  constrains the vehicle and slows it down in order for the *Steering* parameters to have an optimal effect. Additionally, it was noted that the optimal *Throttle Speed* value for the *Steering* parameters to have a full effect, was `40`.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

### Project Overview
As one gets older, an increasingly difficult awareness of our parent's mortality becomes a serious concern. Personally, my parents are both in their early 70's and according to a study[^1] done in __2015__ by the __American Heart Association__, around __370,000__ people die of heart attacks each year and is the __No. 1__ cause of in the United States. In __2014__, around __356,500__ people experienced heart attacks out of the hospital. Of that  amount  only __12%__ survived due to emergency medical services intervention. Personally, I would not like my parents to be one the __88%__ who suffered from a fatal heart attack and didn't survive  due to the fact that there was no intervention by emergency medical services. According to the study, there is a prevalence of almost *third* of the population at risk of *Heart Disease* leading to a *Heart Attack* as one approaches __80+__ years of age. Having no personal experience in the Coronary Field of Medical research, it would be difficult for me to diagnose any potential warning signs, but with the advent of wearable technology, the mechanisms are in place to potentially aid in this early warning and detection of heart attacks. The majority of wearable technology today has the built-in ability to monitor heart rates. Therefore in this project, I proposed that this information can be uploaded or sent to a __data ingestion pipeline__ that this capable of interpreting, analyzing and detecting an the patterns that could be classified as symptoms of a heart attack. 

Additionally, since one of the potential symptoms is the increase in heart rates. There are a number of potential factors that influence the increase in heart rate, but there are well published guidelines[^2] that can be used to determine anomalous patterns. If these anomalies occur, the the __data ingestion pipeline__ could proactively determine if a heart attack is about to *or* has occurred and alert the appropriate emergency medical response. Thus proactively preventing a fatal or near-fatal heart attack. As am added benefit, the __pipeline__ mechanism can be used to monitor patients who are in *Cardiac Rehabilitation*[^3].

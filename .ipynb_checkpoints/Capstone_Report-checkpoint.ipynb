    "### Project Overview\n",
    "As one gets older, an increasingly difficult awareness of our parent's mortality becomes a serious concern. Personally, my parents are both in their early 70's and according to a study[^1] done in __2015__ by the __American Heart Association__, around __370,000__ people die of heart attacks each year and is the __No. 1__ cause of in the United States. In __2014__, around __356,500__ people experienced heart attacks out of the hospital. Of that  amount  only __12%__ survived due to emergency medical services intervention. Personally, I would not like my parents to be one the __88%__ who suffered from a fatal heart attack and didn't survive  due to the fact that there was no intervention by emergency medical services. According to the study, there is a prevalence of almost *third* of the population at risk of *Heart Disease* leading to a *Heart Attack* as one approaches __80+__ years of age. Having no personal experience in the Coronary Field of Medical research, it would be difficult for me to diagnose any potential warning signs, but with the advent of wearable technology, the mechanisms are in place to potentially aid in this early warning and detection of heart attacks. The majority of wearable technology today has the built-in ability to monitor heart rates. Therefore in this project, I proposed that this information can be uploaded or sent to a __data ingestion pipeline__ that this capable of interpreting, analyzing and detecting an the patterns that could be classified as symptoms of a heart attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since one of the potential symptoms is the increase in heart rates. There are a number of potential factors that influence the increase in heart rate, but there are well published guidelines[^2] that can be used to determine anomalous patterns. If these anomalies occur, the the __data ingestion pipeline__ could proactively determine if a heart attack is about to *or* has occurred and alert the appropriate emergency medical response. Thus proactively preventing a fatal or near-fatal heart attack. As am added benefit, the __pipeline__ mechanism can be used to monitor patients who are in *Cardiac Rehabilitation*[^3].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "For this Project, I propose creating a classification pipeline that ingests heart-rate signal data (from a simulated wearable monitor) and classifies whether the subject is in a stressful situation that could lead to *Cardiac Unrest*. Additionally, in order to prevent a \"cry-wolf\" scenario or *false-positives*, the pipeline employs a consensus mechanism where three classifiers must all agree on the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1: Training/Testing Pipeline](images/Pipeline.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the scope of this project however, I propose training three separate supervised machine learning models by applying the following methodology to create the pipeline. Once created, the pipeline (see Figure 1.) will be used to test and deploy the models on a sample unseen data from the test subjects and hence predict their stress levels by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect already filtered PPG [^4] signal data with symbolic peaks (and other features) have been collected for a one-minute time segment. Each one-minute time segment is considered an observation labeled with the class `relax` or `stress`. Separate the input data into two separate repositories. One for the observations and one for the labeled output.\n",
    "2. Apply __Feature Extraction__ and if needed, __normalization__ and/or __standardization__ techniques to  pre-process the data.\n",
    "3. Define three separate models to evaluate the the data.\n",
    "    - Random Forest\n",
    "    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "    - Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "4. Apply the models and measure their performance on a completely __separate__ and as yet __unseen__ dataset. This dataset is exactly the same as the training dataset except it is has no `State` label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final classification is implementing a __Weighted Majority Rule Ensemble Classifier__[^5] based on the probability of the time segment observation belonging to either class, using the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\arg\\\\max_{i}\\sum^{m}_{j=1}w_{j}p_{ij},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $wj$ is the weight that can be assigned to the $j^{th}$ classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once created, the pipeline, will be used to test and deploy the models on a sample unseen data from the new test subjects and hence predict their stress levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "Since the success criteria of the project is based on the overall __probability__ of the time segment observation belonging to either class (`stressed` or `relaxed`), each individual model as well as the overall consensus pipeline will be evaluated using the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Accuracy:__ $\\rightarrow$ The proportion of the total number of predictions that are \"correct\".\n",
    "2. __Recall:__ $\\rightarrow$ The measure of completeness of the classifier. In other words, if the label is `stressed`, how well does the model predict that the subject is `stressed`. Basically, the ratio of the number of observations the model can correctly recall, to the number of all correct observations.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Recall = \\frac{True Positive}{True Positive + False Negative}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Precision:__ $\\rightarrow$ The number of positive predictions divided by the total positive class values. So, precision is the ratio of a number of observations the model can correctly predict to a number of all observations the model can recall. In other words, it is how precise the model's recall is.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Precision = \\frac{True Positive}{True Positive + False Positive}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __F1 Score:__ $\\rightarrow$ If the models are good at *Recall*, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are good at *Precision*. The *F1 Score* is the balanced average of the the two. This balanced *F1 Score* is necessary as an overall performance metric due to the fact that if there is a misclassification that the subject is under stress, but isn't, then the emergency medical services are called out unnecessarily. If however, there is a misclassification that the subject isn't stressed, but actually is, then this could result in a fatality. Having the *F1 Score* will allow us to allocate more weight to *Precision* or *Recall*.\n",
    "$$\n",

    "The dataset used for this Project was obtained as part of a *Proof of Concept (POC)* project in the __Dell IoT Solutions Lab__ [^6] in Santa Clara, California, where a PPG [^4] Pulse sensor was used to measure Heart Rate Variability (HRV) [^7]  reading, similar to those found on current wearables like the __Fitbit Charge 2__ [^8]. The scope of the original POC is simply to verify if the data can be extracted and filtered to detect peaks in the PPG signal for a one minute data segment. Four separate test subjects (between the ages of 68 and 76) were subjected to different stimuli to induce *stress* and *relaxing* scenarios. The one minute observations (__300__ in total) are stored in a `data.csv` file. Each observation has __8__ specific features of the PPG waveform, namely:\n",

    "4. __SDRR__ $\\rightarrow$ Standard Deviation of \"normal\" heart beats.\n",
    "5. __RMSRR__ $\\rightarrow$ Root Mean Squared of \"normal\" hear beats.\n",

    "#### Random Forest\n",
    "The __Random Forest__[^9] classifier (an ensemble method itself) is used to cluster points of data in functional groups. When the data set is large and/or there are many variables it becomes difficult to cluster the data because not all variables can be taken into account, therefore the algorithm can also give a certain chance that a data point belongs in a certain group. Based on this, this classifier is selected as one of the methods due to the fact that the data set are relatively small. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the classification, the algorithm clusters the data in groups and subgroups, or decision trees. At each split of the tree, variables are chosen at random as to whether the data points have a close relationship or not.\n",
    "The algorithm makes multiple trees to create a \"forest\", with each tree being different due to the fact that the decision split occurs on different variables. The classification is used to predict which tree in the forests makes the best classification of the label data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "The __SVM__[^10] is a classifier that tries to draw the *best* line to separate the classifications, in this case `stress` and `relax`. Since there can be multiple decision boundaries to correctly separate the two classes, this model is implemented to find the best separation that maximizes the distance between all the data point in each classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "Since the overall objective for the final pipeline and *weighted majority rule* classifier is based on probability of an observation belonging to one one of the two classes, an obvious choice for the third classification method is the __Gaussian Naive Bayes__[^11] classifier as it is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying *Bayes' theorem* with strong (or naive) independence assumptions between the features. In other words, a *Naive Bayes* classifier considers each feature to contribute independently to the final probability, regardless of any possible correlations between the features.\n",
    "\n",

    "- __min_samples_split__ $\\rightarrow$ The minimum amount of observations required in a node before it can be considered for splitting. This setting has been set to `4` as higher values prevent a model from learning relations that are too specific to a particular \"tree\".\n",
    "- __min_samples_leaf__ $\\rightarrow$ The minimum amount of observations required in a terminal node (leaf node). This setting has been set to `5` which is one value higher then *min_samples_split* as this too controls overfitting.\n",
    "- __max_features__ $\\rightarrow$ The number of features to consider while searching for the best split. This is set to `0.7` (or 70%), to avoid overfitting as the parameter is cross-validated with a 70/30 split.\n",

This setting has been set to a `rbf` (Radial basis function) kernel since the data is not linearly separable.\n",
    "- __gamma__ $\\rightarrow$ This parameter defines how \"far\" the influence for a single training example reaches, with low values meaning \"far\" and high values meaning \"close\". This parameter is required when using a `rbf` kernel and in this setting, the value is set to `0.01` so that the radius of the area of influence of the support vectors only includes the support vector itself.\n",
    "- __C__ $\\rightarrow$ This parameter is also required when using the `rbf` kernel and is used as a trade-off for misclassification. This setting has been set to `1.0` which is relativley low due so as to reduce the complexity of the model and avoid overfitting. \n",
    "- __probability__ $\\rightarrow$ This setting is set to `True` so that the score can be leveraged in the final *Majority Rule Ensemble* classifier.\n",

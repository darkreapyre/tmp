image::images/kubernetes-aws-smile.png[kubernetes and aws logos, 400]

This is a self-paced workshop that explains how to run and manage a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web Services.

It explains how to deploy, scale, and configure applications on this cluster.

This workshop is designed for attendees on Development and Operations teams who would like to get started with Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

This workshop provides instructions to create, manage, and scale a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, as well as how to deploy applications, scale them, run stateless and stateful containers, perform service discovery between different microservices, and other similar concepts.

It also shows deep integration with several AWS technologies.

The proposed agenda is to go through the described format to ramp up your knowledge on Kubernetes by following
the workshop guides.

You are also encouraged to take a detour and explore advanced topics if you feel comfortable
as you move through the workshop.
